<h1>Project2</h1>
<p>My project is a Stop Motion The story is about a group of firends are in a pizza resturant and there is a traitor among them that keeps kinapping each one of them and the group leader with the others that didn't get kinapped has to investigate to find who it is. I added one wired thing (its nothing inapportate first of all) The reason wanted to add a wired thing was becuase I wanted to add a cool graphic effect to make my video interesting.</p>

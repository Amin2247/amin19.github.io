<h1>Project 3</h1>
<p> wanted to do this project to teach NASA to try to send a fox to go to Mars. I wanted to do this becuase I think this would a silly thing and I just want to make people laugh and most importanly I think NASA should really send a fox to Mars instead of the a human to see what can it do in the roketship. My picture shows that in the future that this fox has surived in space and every rockship has changes the tip to fox head to show that this fox has been the first animal to Mars.
My story is about that NASA sends a fox to space with a go pro on its helment. He goes into to astompshere and starts floating then accidenlty opesn the open door and he goes to space. The go pro loses singal. the fox lands on mars after 15 years finally the go pro gets singal and NASA thaught that the fox died but he staied alive. he is tyhe first animal in Mars. NASA is sending reinforcments. 30 years later the rockships tip has turned to fox heads to show the first fox in mars..</p>

<h1>Animated GIF and Collage</h1>
<p>My project shows the bright and colorful photos I made, I really like to show bright and colorful things, I feel satisfied when the color of my college does opposite matches with my background. I also really like how I made the flowers look like in 3D, I thought its a really cool thing that the professor taught us.</p>
